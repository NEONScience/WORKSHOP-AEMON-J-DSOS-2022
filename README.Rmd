<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This repository contains the code that will be used for the AEMON-J/DSOS workshop: An introduction to workflow management software in ecology (https://aquaticdatasciopensci.github.io/day2-bigdata/).

The file `complete_workflow_example.zip` contains the final workflow product for this workshop.

<!-- ****** Prep ****** -->
## Preparation for the workshop
1. Optional, but very helpful! Create an API token using the instructions in the following tutorial, which shouldn't take more than 10 minutes (https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial)
2. Ensure that you have a recent R version installed on your computer. (Tutorial leaders will have version >= 4.2.0)
3. The tutorial leaders will use RStudio, which is also recommended, but optional.
4. Install required packages: `targets`, `neonUtilities`, `tidyverse`, and `lubridate.`
